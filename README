Do this stuff first:

  git clone https://github.com/awong-dev/insanity-scripts.git

To use, you should be able to do:
  path-to-scripts/first-checkout.sh
  cd insanity/ndk
  path-to-scripts/insanity-shell.sh
  cd sources/cxx-stl/llvm-libc++/libcxx/test/utilities/time/time.clock/time.clock.system
  TEST_PREFIX=now run-tests.sh

A number of us found that the build would fail, but running this ourselves fixed it after:
  path-to-scripts/build-libcxx.sh

Make sure you have a github account. Put your ssh public key in your account.

We'll be working from here: https://github.com/awong-dev/ndk/tree/master

Once you've done that, do this:

  cd insanity/ndk
  git remote add origin git@github.com:awong-dev/ndk.git
  git fetch origin
  git checkout -b $USER-work origin/master

Now you have a ''$USER-work'' branch that you can push and request merges from into master on the github website.
